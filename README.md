# User-Authentication-and-Management
 This is a user authentication and management project which allows users to  create their account or register with email and after register they get an mail on their register mail id for varification and after login they are able to update their informations and the admin can also register and check other users informations and  have pawer to edit or delete any user from it. Users can also change their password after hit the forget-password button. I used javascript, Nodejs, Express.js, Template run engine(EJS) and MongoDB database to developed it.
